**CPIC API Data Extraction and Recommendation System**
This repository contains Python scripts for interacting with the CPIC database to extract drug recommendations based on genetic information. The extracted data is processed to create JSON files suitable for training large language models (LLMs).

Overview
**cpic_api.py**
Automates searches through the CPIC database to retrieve drug information linked to specific genes.

Key functionalities:

**Extract_data.py:**
drug_info function: Extracts drug data, including drugid and drugname, to construct API URLs for further database queries.
extract_data function: Retrieves the lookup key for the gene in question.

**testing.py:**
Uses the extracted drugid and gene/diplotype information (e.g., {"CYP2C19": {"*1": 2}}) to search for each drug recommendation according to patient's phenotype.
Aggregates recommendations for each drug into a Python dictionary for further processing.

**test2.py:**
Combines the JSON output from reconciled drug recommendations (based on the gene/diplotype) with gene data.
Produces a prompt-ready JSON file containing drug recommendations, which can be used to train LLMs.

**Agent Development and Deployment** 

**Embedding Creation (retriever.py)**
Generates LangChain OpenAI embeddings for data.
Stores the embeddings in a Chroma database for later use.

**Agent Construction (agent.py)**
Utilizes the stored embeddings with LangChainâ€™s RetrievalQA to develop an intelligent agent capable of answering pharmacogenomic queries.

**Agent Deployment**
Convert data into a document object using LangChain's dataframeLoader function.
Use the .load() function to process the document and save it as a pickle file.
Deploy the agent by loading the pickle file in the application.
